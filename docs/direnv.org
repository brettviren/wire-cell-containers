#+title: Using direnv with a container for easier development

* Problem statement

I find it hard to remember how to "set up" a development environment.
Maybe I have multiple plates spinning or a lot time passes between
visiting an environment.  I want to just do a small number of commands
to "get back" to where I was when I last did some work.

This describes how [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] can be exploited for a solution.  Below I
assume you have read its home page and understand the basics of how it
works. 

Examples will use convention:

#+begin_example
  h$ echo "this is a host prompt"
  c$ echo "this is a container prompt"
#+end_example

* Basic container environment

#+begin_example
  h$ singularity exec --bind /cvmfs -i bash --rcfile wcls.rc
#+end_example

See [[file:../scripts/wcls.rc][example ~wcls.rc~ file]].  Copy it to near your task working areas and customize it.

#+begin_example
  h$ mkdir -p ~/tasks
  h$ cp /path/to/wire-cell-containers/scripts/wcls.rc ~/tasks
#+end_example

* Task environment

#+begin_example

  
#+end_example
